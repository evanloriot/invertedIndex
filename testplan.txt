To test the functionality of our indexer, we created a directory called
Directory0. This directory tests both our indexers ability to tokenize/sort
 words and its ability to recognize files with the same name in nested directories.

FILE CONTENTS:

a.txt: "This an$example12 mail@rutgers"
file.txt (D0): "Good GOOD good gOOd gooD"
A.txt: "Hello!!!I**AM(a^text()()()file!"
file1.txt (D1): "alpha ALPHA Alpha beta BETA beTA gamma GAMMA gamMa"
file1.txt (D2): "This#is a test123that &everything% 3tokenizes*correctly1&"

These files test the program's response to the same word with various upper case and 
lower case letters, as well as different non alphanumerical characters in various locations.
Additionally, the directory as a whole tests the program's ability to treat files with the same 
name as the same, regardless of case or location within the directory.

For a much larger test case, we created a file with several million words and got the runtime,
which was under a second. We also tested the program with a large number of files within the
directory.
